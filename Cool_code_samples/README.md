# About these nice code samples
These code samples belong to other people and I take no credit for them. You'll find a commend at the beginning of each file citing the source I found them in as well as the username/alias of the one who uploaded it where applicable. I just wanted to keep these handy for reference and I thought it couldn't hurt if more people took a look at it. If you are the author of one of these and want it removed feel free to contact me through the e-mail found in my GitHub profile. I'm sorry if it bothered you... As these samples were already public I assumed it was okay to reupload them :smile_cat:.
