# Various dotfiles for making my system feel like home (at least for me...)
Feel free to use them for whatever purpose! Note I'm treating the repositorie's root as my home directory when dealing with paths and the like...

Nothe the `kitty-themes` folder is itself anotrher repository belonging to [`@dexpota`](https://github.com/dexpota). You can find the original repository [here](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes). We have just removed the `.git` folder because we are happy enough with the current themes already!
